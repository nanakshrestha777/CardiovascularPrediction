Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on health indicators. A voting classifier ensemble method, combining Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, achieves robust performance. LIME provides model interpretability. The model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive use.

Dataset: Cardiovascular Disease Dataset

Key Features:

Data cleaning and transformation (handling outliers, feature engineering)

Model selection and evaluation (cross-validation, ROC curve analysis)

Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

Ensemble modeling with voting classifier

Model interpretation with LIME

Deployment with Streamlit

Further Improvements:

Incorporate additional features (lifestyle, genetics)

Explore alternative ensemble techniques

Implement SHAP for deeper interpretability

Analyze non-linear feature dependencies

Statistically validate gender differences within blood pressure categories
